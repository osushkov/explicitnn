# ExplicitNeuralNets

An implementation of a simple multi-layered neural network and stochastic gradient descent for learning, using back-propagation.

Mainly this is an excercise for my own benefit, playing around with some new features of C++11/14 and getting familiar again
with the language. 

Dependencies:
C++11/14
tup used for as build system
